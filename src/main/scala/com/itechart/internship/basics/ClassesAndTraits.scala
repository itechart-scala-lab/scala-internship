  // Classes in Scala are blueprints for creating object instances. They can contain methods, values,
  // variables, types, objects, traits, and classes which are collectively called members.

      y = y + dy
    }

    override def toString: String =
      s"($x, $y)"
  }

  // Singleton objects are defined using `object`.
  // It is a class that has exactly one instance.
  // An object with the same name as a class is called a companion object.
  //
  // Use it to contain methods and values related to this trait or class, but that aren't
  // specific to instances of this trait or class.
  object MovableLocation {
    def apply(x: Double, y: Double): MovableLocation = new MovableLocation(x, y)

    def unapply(point: MovableLocation): Option[(Double, Double)] = Option((point.x, point.y))
  }

  val location1 = new MovableLocation(3, 4)

  // Question. Is MutablePoint a good design? Why or why not?

  // Traits define a common interface that classes conform to. They are similar to Java's interfaces.

  // A trait can be thought of as a contract that defines the capabilities and behaviour of a component.

  // Subtyping
  // Where a given trait is required, a subtype of the trait can be used instead.

  // Classes and singleton objects can extend traits.
  //
  // This allows "programming to the interface" approach where you depend on traits instead of their
  // specific implementations (classes or objects).
  //
  // This makes code more reusable and testable.

  // Exercise 1: implement Ship case class which will extend Vehicle and contain new property `displacement`
  // final case class Ship()

  // Case Classes
  //
  // Case classes are like regular classes, but with extra features which make them good for modelling
  // immutable data. They have all the functionality of regular classes, but the compiler generates additional
  // code, such as:
  // - Case class constructor parameters are public `val` fields, publicly accessible
  // - `apply` method is created in the companion object, so you don't need to use `new` to create a new
  //   instance of the class
  // - `unapply` method which allows you to use case classes in `match` expressions (pattern matching)
  // - a `copy` method is generated
  // - `equals` and `hashCode` methods are generated, which let you compare objects & use them in collections
  // - `toString` method is created for easier debugging purposes
  // - extends Serializable
  //
  // Case object provides default equals, hashCode, unapply, toString methods, extends Serializable
  //
  // When declaring a case class, make it final. Otherwise someone may decide to inherit from it
  // case-to-case inheritance is prohibited

  // Generic classes and type parameters

  // In a similar way as we saw with polymorphic methods, classes and traits can also take type parameters.
  // For example, you can define a `Stack[A]` which works with any type of element `A`.

  // Question. Do you agree with how the stack is modelled here? What would you do differently?
